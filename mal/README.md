**Model Assisted Labeling Directory**

Contains code to use a (trained) model to make initial predictions, extract the annoations in polygon format, and upload the images with annotations to Labelbox.com.

> :exclamation: Note that this `mal` module uses a different python environment than the rest of the project. So create a seperate environment from `mal/requirements.txt`.
