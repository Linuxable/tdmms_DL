Saves only best weights:
keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(self.checkpoint_path, monitor="val_loss", mode="min",
                                            verbose=0, save_weights_only=True),
                                            verbose=0, save_weights_only=True, save_best_only=True),

Tensorflow and CUDA compatibility: https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/install/source.md

This maybe also works: tensorflow-2.4.0 with cuda-11.1 and cudnn 8.0.5.


Changed amount of workers:
use_multiprocessing=workers > 1,
            use_multiprocessing=False,
