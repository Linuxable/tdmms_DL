@Tzu-Jan I think you should upgrade your python to 3.8
My solution worked when I used tensorflow 2.4.0 with python3.8 (using the tf2 version of the net by https://github.com/leekunhee/Mask_RCNN/tree/tensorflow2.0)


Hi everyone solved this problem on colab.
python 3.7.10
!pip install 'h5py==2.10.0' --force-reinstall
!pip uninstall keras-nightly
!pip uninstall -y tensorflow
!pip install tensorflow_gpu==2.4.0
!pip install keras==2.4.0
!pip install keras --user
!pip uninstall keras-preprocessing
!pip install git+https://github.com/keras-team/keras-preprocessing.git
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()
tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()

you should with this order on colab it worked for me !
